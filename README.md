# VibratoScope

**VibratoScope** is a Python toolkit for the analysis of vibrato in the singing voice. It provides automatic extraction of vibrato rate, extent (in cents), jitter, sample entropy, and generates summary plots. A user-friendly GUI is included for selection of analysis regions and batch processing.

- Bandpass filtering (3–9 Hz) for vibrato isolation.
- Calculation of:
  - Vibrato rate (Hz)
  - Extent (cents)
  - Jitter metrics
  - Sample Entropy
  - Coefficient of variability
- Visualizations saved automatically as PNGs.
- CSV export of region-based and global results.
